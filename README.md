This is a simple stopwatch project created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Index.html file :
Basic structure of the HTML page is provided in this file. A background image is added to the body of the webpage and a "div" containing the stopwatch is present which will emulate a stopwatch.


style.css file :
This file is used to provide simple styling to the webpage. All the bakground images, button images, margins padding etc properties on the webpage are given using the code in this file. We have then linked this file to the main index.html file.


script.js file : 
Code written in this file is used to provide dynamic behaviour to our stopwatch on the frontend. Functions are written for starting, stopping and resetting the stopwatch whenever the 3 buttons on are clicked on the screen.
